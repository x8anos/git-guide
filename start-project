Step 1. Start a new repository in Github. Don't try any of the choices-just
keep it simple.

Step 2. With git bash go to the folder in which you wish to include your new
project-repo eg cd programming(folder's name). There type:
git init js - this is going to create a new repo called js which is a subfolder
of programming.

Step 3. Type: cd js
              atom readme.txt
So you've gone to folder-repo js and created a new file inside called readme.

Step 4. Make your changes to the file.

Step 5. git add readme.txt

Step 6. git commit

Step 7. Using the url from github for your repo type:
git remote add origin https://github.com/x8anos/js.git

Step 8. git push origin master

You 're done!!!!
